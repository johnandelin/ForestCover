# ForestCover

This project is based on the Forest Cover Type Prediction competition on Kaggle. The task is to predict the type of forest cover (e.g., Spruce Fir, Lodgepole Pine) for a given 30x30 meter plot of land using cartographic variables such as elevation, soil type, and distances to water and roads.

This is a multiclass classification problem with seven target classes. The dataset includes both continuous and categorical features, and the challenge is to build a model that can accurately map these environmental attributes to the correct cover type.

Using machine learning models and feature preprocessing, my final submission achieved a Kaggle score of 0.78047.
